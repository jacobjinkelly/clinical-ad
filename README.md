# 80k_abbreviations
Code for "Improving abbreviation disambiguation in clinical notes using local and global contexts", final project for [CSC2541: Machine Learning For Health](https://cs2541-ml4h2019.github.io/index.html)

There are two Jupyter notebooks (and corresponding static HTML) reproducing the main results from our paper: 

`baselines/baselines.ipynb` for the baseline models
`create_samples/concept_embeddings/csc2541_finalProject_results.ipynb` for the CEM model 


***NOTE:
If you want to view code for training the concept embedding models, they are in a folder called create_samples/concept_embeddings. Sorry, I know it's not a good name.
