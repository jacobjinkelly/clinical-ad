Code for "A conceptual route to unsupervised medical abbreviation disambiguation", final project for [CSC2541: Machine Learning For Health](https://cs2541-ml4h2019.github.io/index.html)

There are two Jupyter notebooks (and corresponding static HTML) reproducing the main results from our paper: 

`baselines/baselines.ipynb` for the baseline models
`train_model/concept_embeddings/csc2541_finalProject_results.ipynb` for the concept embedding model
